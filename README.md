ðŸ“Š RVI â€“ Relative Volume Indicator (by @sruiztrades)

A custom Pine Script indicator that visualizes short-term volume strength relative to long-term historical volume using a dual-average model. Designed for traders who want to easily spot abnormal accumulation or distribution zones.

## ðŸ”§ What It Does

- Uses a **6-bar EMA** of volume as the fast signal
- Compares it against a **200-bar SMA** baseline (adaptive average volume)
- **Color-codes volume bars** based on relative magnitude:
  - ðŸŸ¤ **Light Taupe** â†’ Volume > 1.5Ã— trailing average (strong accumulation/distribution)
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Beige-Gold** â†’ Volume > average, but < 1.5Ã— (moderate strength)
  - ðŸ”µ **Deep Blue** â†’ Volume < trailing average (low activity)
- Plots the trailing average as a translucent reference line
- Shown in a subpanel (like RSI or MACD)

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Use Case

- **Breakout Confirmation:** Strong light taupe bar â†’ conviction
- **Accumulation Zones:** Series of beige bars in an uptrend â†’ hidden buying
- **Avoid Choppy Entries:** Blue bars â†’ dead zone, wait for volume confirmation

## ðŸ§ª How It Works (Code Logic)

```pinescript
// 200-bar SMA as baseline volume
trail_avg_vol = ta.sma(volume, 200)

// 6-bar EMA as fast signal
fast_Average = ta.ema(volume, 6)

// Dynamic bar color logic
dyn_color = if (fast_Average > trail_avg_vol * 1.5)
    color.new(#afaaa0, 12)  // Light taupe, strong pressure
else if (fast_Average > trail_avg_vol)
    color.new(#c2b280, 24)  // Beige-gold, moderate strength
else
    color.new(#395ea1, 31)  // Deep blue, low volume

## ðŸ’¡ Design Philosophy

This tool was created to solve a real problem I noticed as a young trader: volume is meaningless without context. Over years, I saw stocks shift between high and low liquidity regimes, making raw volume useless. By adapting to long-term baselines and highlighting deviations, this tool brings volume into context.
